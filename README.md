DURATION : 4 WEEKS

##I have successfully designed and developed a front-end E-Learning Platform UI as part of my internship task. The main objective of this project was to create a styled and interactive multi-page interface that simulates a basic online learning system. The platform includes essential features such as course listing, video embedding for learning content, and progress tracking functionality. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The platform is divided into multiple pages to create a structured and realistic learning experience. The Home page displays a list of available courses in a clean card-based layout. Each course card contains the course title, a short description, and a “Start Learning” button. This design ensures that users can easily browse and select courses. The navigation bar at the top allows smooth movement between the Home page and the Progress page, making the interface user-friendly and organized.

When a user selects a course, they are redirected to a dedicated course page where a video lecture is embedded using an iframe. This demonstrates the integration of multimedia learning content into a web application. The video page also includes a “Mark as Completed” button, allowing users to track their learning progress. This feature adds interactivity to the platform and improves user engagement.

One of the key features implemented in this project is progress tracking using the browser’s LocalStorage. When a user marks a course as completed, the course name is stored locally in the browser. The Progress page dynamically retrieves this stored data and displays a list of completed courses. This simulates a real-world learning management system where users can monitor their achievements. By implementing LocalStorage, I learned how to handle client-side data storage without using a backend database.

The user interface was styled using CSS to provide a clean, modern, and professional appearance. I used layout techniques such as flexbox to properly align course cards and maintain consistent spacing. Button hover effects and shadow styling were added to improve visual appeal and interactivity. The overall design focuses on simplicity, readability, and ease of navigation.

Through this project, I gained practical experience in building a structured multi-page website, linking pages using navigation menus, passing data through URL parameters, embedding external video content, and managing user interaction with JavaScript. The project demonstrates my understanding of core front-end development concepts and my ability to design an interactive web-based application.

In conclusion, this E-Learning Platform UI project successfully fulfills the internship requirement of creating a styled and interactive multi-page interface. It reflects my ability to combine design and functionality while implementing real-world features such as course management and progress tracking. This project has enhanced my confidence in front-end development and strengthened my practical coding skills.##
